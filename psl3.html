        <p><strong>Service Line Group:</strong> Non-destructive Examination (NDE)
        <strong>Service Line:</strong> Magnetic Particle Inspection (MAG)</p>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong>
        Magnetic Particle Inspection (MT) is a method of 
        <strong>Surface Non-Destructive Examination</strong> used to identify surfaceand slight sub-surface discontinuities in ferromagnetic materials (aka materials that can be magnetized). MT works by running a current through the ferromagnetic material to create a magnetic field around it. Anywhere a discontinuity occurs, there will be a “break” in the magnetic field. Particles (wet or dry, visual or fluorescent) are then applied and will be attracted to the break in the magnetic field forming an “indication” for the Technician to evaluate for acceptance or rejection based on the referencing code or standard. The methods for magnetizing the material include:
    </p>
<ol>
    <li>Yoke – the Technician uses a handheld yoke to magnetize a small area (up to 6”) while applying particles </li>

    <li>Bench – parts are placed in a bench unit (usually a 4’ tall and 6’ long table), a current is passed through the part to create a magnetic field, then particles are applied</li>

    <li>Coil Wrap – long cables, similar to welding leads, are wrapped around the part and then energized to create the magnetic field, then particles are applied
    To ensure a part is fully tested, it is often necessary to apply two magnetic fields 90° apart in separate operations. Depending on the material, after the part is magnetized, sometimes demagnetization is required.</li>
    
</ol>
        <p><strong>On-stream or shutdown:</strong> Can be both</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Typically part of Turnaround:</strong>  Yes</p>

        <p><strong>TEAM Capabilities:</strong></p>  
        <ul>
        <li>Most TEAM IHT districts have Technicians certified in the Yoke method and can provide both visual and fluorescent inspections</li>
        <li>Bench type inspections are completed generally in a Lab setting (Phoenix, Denver, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Wood River, Milwaukee and a few others.) </li>
        <li>Coil units are mobile (a few offices have them, and they are available to rent)</li>
        </ul>


        <p><strong>TEAM Value Proposition for this PSL:</strong></p>
        <ul>
<li>Inspection helps the client increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of their assets by allowing them to understand the status of their assets and plan preventative service accordingly to help extend the life of the asset and align its maintenance schedule around planned outages rather than shutting down for unexpected repairs
    </li>

<li>Allows a portable, inexpensive, and immediate assessment of the surface and slight sub-surface of a material</li>

<li>Using adequately trained technicians and properly maintained equipment, a technician can inspect material rather quickly and easily versus other inspection methods </li>

<li>Can be used to test all ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic materials (MT is only ferromagnetic)</li>

<li>Little surface preparation is necessary</li>

<li>Virtually any size or shape can be tested</li>
<li>Is applicable to fabrication shop and field construction</li>
        </ul>
<p><strong>Key Sources of TEAM Competitive Advantage for this PSL:</strong></p>
<ol>
        <li>Non-Destructive Testing consists of many complex (and often complementary) methods - TEAM's highly trained experts can help select the most cost and time effective services or suite of services that is right for any situation</li>


<li>TEAM has some of the best training and internal certifying procedures in the world – highly trained and certified personnel to perform the test, interpret the results, and make recommendations for further actions</li>

<li>Geographical footprint allows TEAM to provide services in almost any work location</li>
</ol>
