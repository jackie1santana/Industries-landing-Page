        </em></h1>
       
        <p>Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) is a method of <strong>Non-destructive Examination</strong> that can determine the alloy composition of materials.</p>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong>
    Positive Material Identification (PMI) is a method of 
        <strong>Surface Non-Destructive Examination</strong> that can determine the alloy composition of materials.
</p>

<p>There are several accepted techniques for PMI testing, including <strong>PMI, XRF</strong> and <strong>OES.</strong> OES involves generating a spark on a metal’s surface. The energy of the <strong>spark</strong> causes the electrons in the sample to emit light, which is converted into a spectral pattern. By measuring the intensity of the peaks in this spectrum, the <strong>OES analyzer</strong> can produce qualitative and quantitative analysis of the material composition. </p>

<p>Although OES is considered a nondestructive testing method, the spark does leave a small burn on the sample surface. OES equipment is not as mobile as PMI or XRF equipment, but it can be used in most locations if preparations are made. OES equipment is capable of measuring Carbon and the lighter elements and can distinguish most grades of carbon steel.  Since this equipment does not use radiation, no radiation safety concerns apply.</p>

        <p><strong>On-stream or shutdown:</strong> Can be both</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Typically part of Turnaround:</strong>  Yes</p>

        <p><strong>TEAM Capabilities:</strong></p>

        <ul>

        <li>Inspection helps the client increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of their assets by allowing them to understand their assets and plan accordingly based on inspection results</li>
<br>
        <p><strong>Importance is increasing as:</strong></p>

       <li>Periodic plant maintenance shutdowns are less frequent and consequently the materials used in the plant are in use longer
</li>
       
<li>Specifications for materials used in industry are increasingly more specific
    </li>

<li>Difficulty is increasing as a wider variety of alloys are being used that are indistinguishable to the eye</li>


<li>OES is generally considered to be more accurate than PMI or XRF</li>

<li>OES is the only method that can detect carbon and the lighter elements (can measure the carbon content of steel when Carbon Equivalency measurements are needed)
    </li>

<li>OES equipment can be used in most places if preparations are made (XRF and PMI are much more mobile)</li>

<li>OES does not use radiation, so no radiation safety concerns apply
</li>

<li>Using adequately trained technicians, and properly maintained equipment, technician can measure an alloy composition in just a few minutes</li>
<li>Using adequately trained technicians, and properly maintained equipment, technician can measure an alloy composition in around an hour
    </li>

<li>More surface preparation is necessary than XRF or PMI</li>
<li>Is applicable to fabrication shop and field construction</li>
        </ul>
