        <p><strong>Service Line Group:</strong> Non-destructive Examination (NDE)
        <strong>Service Line:</strong> Positive Material Identification (PMI)
    </p>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong>
    Positive Material Identification (PMI) is a method of 
        <strong>Surface Non-Destructive Examination</strong> that can determine the alloy composition of materials.
</p>

<p>There are several accepted techniques for PMI testing, including <strong>PMI, XRF</strong> and <strong>OES.</strong> While technically each of these techniques is PMI, the traditional definition of the term PMI involves interrogation of a metals surface with a beam of radiation produced by a <strong>radioactive source.</strong>  This incident radiation beam interacts with the alloy elements to generate secondary radiation scatter which is measured by the PMI equipment.  Each element in the alloy produces a unique and characteristic scatter radiation from which the elements in the alloy can be identified and quantified.</p>

<p>PMI equipment is generally hand held, battery operated, fully mobile, and can be used in most locations. PMI equipment is not capable of measuring Carbon and the lighter elements. Also, traditional methods of generating X-rays have used radioactive isotopes, the use of which requires much documentation and safety considerations.

        <p><strong>On-stream or shutdown:</strong> Can be both</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Typically part of Turnaround:</strong>  Yes</p>

        <p><strong>TEAM Capabilities:</strong></p>
        <p> Most Team districts have several PMI units of various makes, and if properly maintained can be mobilized with little notice.
        </p>  
       

        <p><strong>TEAM Value Proposition for this PSL:</strong></p>
        <ul>
<li>Inspection helps the client increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of their assets by allowing them to understand their assets and plan accordingly based on inspection results
    </li>

<li>Knowing material composition is becoming increasingly important and increasingly more difficult</li>
<p>Importance is increasing as:</p>

<li>Periodic plant maintenance shutdowns are less frequent and consequently the materials used in the plant are in use longer </li>

<li>Difficulty is increasing as a wider variety of alloys are being used that are indistinguishable to the eye</li>

<li>Little surface preparation is necessary</li>

<li>Equipment is hand held, battery operated, and fully mobile (OES is much less mobile)
</li>

<li>Using adequately trained technicians, and properly maintained equipment, technician can measure an alloy composition in just a few minutes</li>
<li>Little surface preparation is necessary</li>
<li>Is applicable to fabrication shop and field construction</li>
        </ul>

<p><strong>Key Sources of TEAM Competitive Advantage for this PSL:</strong></p>
<ol>
        <li>Non-Destructive Testing consists of many complex (and often complementary) methods - TEAM's highly trained experts can help select the most cost and time effective services or suite of services that is right for any situation</li>


<li>TEAM has some of the best training and internal certifying procedures in the world – highly trained and certified personnel to perform the test, interpret the results, and make recommendations for further actions</li>

<li>Geographical footprint allows TEAM to provide services in almost any work location</li>
</ol>
